RUSLE Model integration into web app for soil erosion assessment

Overview
The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is a widely-used empirical model developed to estimate soil erosion rates. RUSLE provides a framework for predicting the average annual soil loss caused by sheet and rill erosion on agricultural land. It considers various factors contributing to erosion, allowing for informed land management decisions to mitigate soil loss.

Purpose
The RUSLE model aims to quantify soil erosion rates by taking into account six primary factors:

Rainfall and Runoff (R)
Soil Erodibility (K)
Slope Length and Steepness (LS)
Crop and Vegetative Cover (C)
Conservation Practices (P)
Support Practices (Erosion Control) (M)
How RUSLE Works
The RUSLE model estimates soil loss (A) using the equation:
A = R * K * LS * C * P * M
Usage
Inputs:
Rainfall and Runoff (R): Historical or estimated rainfall data.
Soil Erodibility (K): Soil characteristics related to erodibility.
Slope Length and Steepness (LS): Measurement of slope length and gradient.
Crop and Vegetative Cover (C): Type and coverage of vegetation.
Conservation Practices (P): Effectiveness of conservation measures.
Support Practices (Erosion Control) (M): Additional erosion control practices.
Outputs:
Soil Loss (A): Estimated average annual soil loss in tons per acre or metric tonnes per hectare.
Applications
Agricultural Management: Helps in making informed decisions about soil conservation practices and land use planning.
Environmental Impact Assessment: Assists in assessing the environmental impact of land use changes or development projects.
Policy Formulation: Supports the development of policies related to soil conservation and land management.
